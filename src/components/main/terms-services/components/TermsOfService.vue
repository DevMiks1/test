          2. The Service is strictly limited to providing a Service for Drivers
          and Riders to Rideshare by the company’s capacity. The services may
          not be used to offer or accept car sharing for profit or in any
          personal context.

          breach by a User of these Terms of Service including where any Driver
          (in breach of these Terms of Service) offers services through the
          Service in a personal capacity (thereby potentially invalidating their

          not interfere with Trips, destinations or timings. OWTO is not liable
          in respect of any matter arising which relates to a Booking between
          Users and Drivers. OWTO is not and will not act as an agent for any
          User.
